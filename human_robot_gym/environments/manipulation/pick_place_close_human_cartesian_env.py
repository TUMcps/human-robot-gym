"""This file describes a variant for the cartesian action space pick place task.

In this variant, the human moves more closely to the robot and inhibits the robot's movement more strongly.
This is achieved by using a different set of human animations.

class PickPlaceCloseHumanCart(PickPlaceHumanCart):
    """This class corresponds to the pick place task for a single robot arm in a human environment
    with strongly inhibiting human animations.

    Args:
        robots (str | List[str]): Specification for specific robot arm(s) to be instantiated within this env
            (e.g: `"Sawyer"` would generate one arm; `["Panda", "Panda", "Sawyer"]` would generate three robot arms)
            Note: Must be a single single-arm robot!

        robot_base_offset (None | List[float] | List[List[float]]): Offset (x, y, z) of the robot bases.
            If more than one robot is loaded provide a list of doubles, one for each robot.
            Specify `None` for an offset of (0, 0, 0) for each robot.

        env_configuration (str): Specifies how to position the robots within the environment (default is `"default"`).
            For most single arm environments, this argument has no impact on the robot setup.

        controller_configs (None | str | List[Dict[str, Any]]): If set, contains relevant controller parameters
            for creating a custom controller. Else, uses the default controller for this specific task.
            Should either be single dict if same controller is to be used for all robots or else it should be
            a list of the same length as `robots` param

        gripper_types (str | List[str]): type of gripper, used to instantiate
            gripper models from gripper factory. Default is `"default"`, which is the default grippers(s) associated
            with the robot(s) the `robots` specification. `None` removes the gripper, and any other (valid) model
            overrides the default gripper. Should either be single `str` if same gripper type is to be used for all
            robots or else it should be a list of the same length as the `robots` param

        initialization_noise (Dict[str, Any] | List[Dict[str, Any]]): Dict containing the initialization noise
            parameters. The expected keys and corresponding value types are specified below:

            :`'magnitude'`: The scale factor of uni-variate random noise applied to each of a robot's given initial
                joint positions. Setting this value to `None` or `0.0` results in no noise being applied.
                If `"gaussian"` type of noise is applied then this magnitude scales the standard deviation applied,
                If `"uniform"` type of noise is applied then this magnitude sets the bounds of the sampling range
            :`'type'`: Type of noise to apply. Can either specify `"gaussian"` or `"uniform"`

            Should either be single dict if same noise value is to be used for all robots or else it should be a
            list of the same length as `robots` param

            :Note: Specifying `"default"` will automatically use the default noise settings.
                Specifying `None` will automatically create the required dict with `"magnitude"` set to `0.0`.

        table_full_size (Tuple[float, float, float]): x, y, and z dimensions of the table.

        table_friction (Tuple[float, float, float]): the three mujoco friction parameters for
            the table.

        object_full_size (Tuple[float, float, float]): x, y, and z dimensions of the cube object that should be moved.

        use_camera_obs (bool): if `True`, every observation includes rendered image(s)

        use_object_obs (bool): if `True`, include object information in the observation.

        reward_scale (None | float): Scales the normalized reward function by the amount specified.
            If `None`, environment reward remains unnormalized

        reward_shaping (bool): if `True`, use dense rewards, else use sparse rewards.

        goal_dist (float): Distance threshold for reaching the goal.

        n_object_placements_sampled_per_100_steps (int): How many object placements to sample at resets
            per 100 steps in the horizon.
            After all objects of the list have been placed, restart from the first in the list.
            This is done to ensure the same list of objects can be placed when loading the env state from a file.

        n_targets_sampled_per_100_steps (int): How many targets to sample at resets per 100 steps in the horizon.
            After all goals of the list have been reached, restart from the first in the list.
            This is done to ensure the same list of goals can be played when loading the env state from a file.
            Setting `n_targets_sampled_per_100_steps != n_object_placements_sampled_per_100_steps`
            yields more possible object-goal combinations.

        collision_reward (float): Reward to be given in the case of a collision.

        task_reward (float): Reward to be given in the case of reaching the goal.

        object_gripped_reward (float): Additional reward for gripping the object when `reward_shaping=False`.
            If object is not gripped: `reward = -1`.
            If object gripped but not at the target: `object_gripped_reward`.
            If object is at the target: `reward = task_reward`.
            `object_gripped_reward` defaults to `-1`.

        object_placement_initializer (ObjectPositionSampler): if provided, will
            be used to place objects on every reset, else a `UniformRandomSampler`
            is used by default.
            Objects are elements that can and should be manipulated.

        target_placement_initializer (ObjectPositionSampler): if provided, will
            be used to generate target locations every time the previous target was reached
            and on resets. If not set, a `UniformRandomSampler` is used by default.
            Targets specify the coordinates to which the object should be moved.

        obstacle_placement_initializer (ObjectPositionSampler): if provided, will
            be used to place obstacles on every reset, else a `UniformRandomSampler`
            is used by default.
            Obstacles are elements that should be avoided.

        has_renderer (bool): If `True`, render the simulation state in
            a viewer instead of headless mode.

        has_offscreen_renderer (bool): `True` if using off-screen rendering

        render_camera (str): Name of camera to render if `has_renderer` is `True`. Setting this value to `None`
            will resul` in the default angle being applied, which is useful as it can be dragged / panned by
            the user using the mouse

        render_collision_mesh (bool): `True` if rendering collision meshes in camera. `False` otherwise.

        render_visual_mesh (bool): `True` if rendering visual meshes in camera. `False` otherwise.

        render_gpu_device_id (int): corresponds to the GPU device id to use for offscreen rendering.
            Defaults to `-1`, in which case the device will be inferred from environment variables
            (`GPUS` or `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`).

        control_freq (float): how many control signals to receive in every second. This sets the amount of
            simulation time that passes between every action input.

        horizon (int): Every episode lasts for exactly `horizon` action steps.

        ignore_done (bool): `True` if never terminating the environment (ignore `horizon`).

        hard_reset (bool): If `True`, re-loads model, sim, and render object upon a `reset` call, else,
            only calls `self.sim.reset` and resets all robosuite-internal variables

        camera_names (str | List[str]): name of camera to be rendered. Should either be single `str` if
            same name is to be used for all cameras' rendering or else it should be a list of cameras to render.

            :Note: At least one camera must be specified if `use_camera_obs` is `True`.

            :Note: To render all robots' cameras of a certain type (e.g.: `"robotview"` or `"eye_in_hand"`), use the
                convention `"all-{name}"` (e.g.: `"all-robotview"`) to automatically render all camera images from each
                robot's camera list).

        camera_heights (int | List[int]): height of camera frame. Should either be single `int` if
            same height is to be used for all cameras' frames or else it should be a list of the same length as
            `camera_names` param.

        camera_widths (int | List[int]): width of camera frame. Should either be single `int` if
            same width is to be used for all cameras' frames or else it should be a list of the same length as
            `camera_names` param.

        camera_depths (bool | List[bool]): `True` if rendering RGB-D, and RGB otherwise. Should either be single
            bool if same depth setting is to be used for all cameras or else it should be a list of the same length as
            `camera_names` param.

        camera_segmentations (None | str | List[str] | List[List[str]]): Camera segmentation(s) to use
            for each camera. Valid options are:

                `None`: no segmentation sensor used
                `'instance'`: segmentation at the class-instance level
                `'class'`: segmentation at the class level
                `'element'`: segmentation at the per-geom level

            If not `None`, multiple types of segmentations can be specified. A [List[str] / str | None] specifies
            [multiple / a single] segmentation(s) to use for all cameras. A List[List[str]] specifies per-camera
            segmentation setting(s) to use.

        renderer (str): string for the renderer to use

        renderer_config (dict): dictionary for the renderer configurations

        n_animations_sampled_per_100_steps (int): How many animations to sample at resets per 100 steps in the horizon.
            After all animations of the list have been played, restart from the first animation in the list.
            This is done to ensure the same list of animations can be played when loading the env state from a file.
